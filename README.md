## Installation
You need Forge 1.8.9 to run this mod, which you can download from [minecraftforge.net](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.8.9.html).

If you have Forge installed, find the latest version of Ranked TKR Helper on the [Github Release page](https://github.com/j3ltr/ranked-tkr-helper/releases/latest) and download the file ending in `.jar`.
Drag this file into your mods folder and start playing!

**Note that this mod requires Essential to work.**
If you don't have it installed yet, it will automatically do so when you start your game.
You can read this [wiki article](https://essential.gg/wiki/installed-by-other-mods) to find out why this mod uses Essential, or visit [essential.gg](https://essential.gg) to learn more about Essential itself.

#### Want to compile the project yourself?
Instead of grabbing the `.jar` file from the Github Release page, you can compile the project yourself.

Simply download or clone the project and run `gradlew build` inside the project folder, optionally specifying the JDK version by adding `-Dorg.gradle.java.home=<JDK_PATH>`.
Make sure to use JDK version 17.

If the build is successful, you can find the `.jar` file in the `build/libs` folder.
